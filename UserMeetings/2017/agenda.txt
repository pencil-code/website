- pencil GPU/CUDA, astaroth (Matthias, Johannes)

- state of the 'particles' modules: reorganisation, avoiding overlap, swarms as a sub-module?; + documentation. (Nils + Chao-Chin & Wlad, remotely)

- decoupling sample (which is huge) from website

- HDF5

- git/svn

- python/pencilnew (Simon)

- diffusion of cosmic rays (Luiz, Andrew, Graeme)

- overset grids (Joergen)

- code stability/timestep control/code units (Fred)

- pencil-code boundary conditions (Matthias)

- reorganising special modules (moving more code into, or out of, specials), using multiple specials, linking to special modules dynamically?

- auto-test (stop using g95 compiler, start using pgi as an additional option ( on which machine)?  streamline suite of 53 samples?)

- PC paper (resuscitate idea of special issue).  Re-try Physica Scripta?  other possibilities: SIAM J Sci Comp, JPP, GAFD.

- chase up alternative ways to track pencil-using publications (cf. ADS bumblebee)

- chase up whitelisting of norlx51b, for people currently being blacklisted

- other possible topics (but not currently prioritised for meeting):

  - reorganising the code to separate 'engine' from 'toolbox'
  - reducing size of compiled src directory.  (dynamical linking?)
  - yin-yang grid
  - f2003
  - non-equidistant grid (glitch in deriv_alt)

- future PC user meetings: Boulder, Ventura, elsewhere...?
