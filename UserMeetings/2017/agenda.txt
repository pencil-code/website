+ pencil GPU/CUDA, astaroth: implementation for basic hydro problem (samples/gputest) almost complete. [Matthias, Johannes]

+ particles' modules: new 'particles_intertial' module, without swarms, to be created from particles_dust.  most particles_* modules to be moved to a subdirectory src/particles (cf. src/magnetic). [Nils, Chao-Chin, Dhruba]

+ 'decoupling sample from website': Create new 'highlights'/'production_runs' directory in repository, for 'serious' simulations (cf. the smaller problems considered in samples).  Also expand highlights on website with additional examples (chase up individuals currently with unexpanded listings). Adopt *.md format for README files on github. [Many]

- python/pencilnew: these (more object-orientated) python scripts now functional for most purposes; users encouraged to use them.

- HDF5: currently implemented, beyond minor issue with persistent variables (particularly any processor-dependent variables: e.g. random seed?). 

- git/svn. Previously-suggested alternatives to the current hosting on github were not considered acceptable. (Without paying for hosting, bitbucket only allows five committers, which is unworkable for pencil;  and most people were unhappy with the idea of a private server.)  So in the absence of other specific suggestions (?), we continue with the status quo.

x code stability/timestep control: additional dt-control functionality added for momentum equation, via lcdt_tauf. [Fred]

- pencil-code boundary conditions: one-sided b.c.s implemented, avoiding overspecification of b.c.s by current 'a'/'s' options. But currently prone to instability. (Matthias)

- reorganising code to allow multiple special modules: in principle possible, but more concrete applications where this is needed are requested, before proceeding.  (And before this is done, there is no need to link to special modules dynamically.)

+ auto-test: stop using g95 compiler, start using pgi as an additional option (on norlx51 or scylla?). [?]

+ PC paper: revive the idea of a special issue.  Possible destinations: Physica Scripta; SIAM J Sci Comp; GAFD; Comp Phys Commun; JPP.  Possible guest-editors: Fred and Simon.  A revised list of likely submissions to be chased up.  [Simon, Fred]

- chase up alternative ways to track pencil-code-using publications (cf. ADS bumblebee); any possibilities on Web of Science?

- chase up whitelisting of norlx51b, for people currently being blacklisted

- documentation: some (many?) modules not currentl documented in manual.

- registering: do all registering from register_* subroutines. Do all put_shared_variable calls in register_*.  Do all get_shared_variable calls in initialize_*. 

- code style: it is proposed that we avoid using labelled-if structures shorter than, say, 20 lines of code.

- yin-yang grid: progress currently stalled due to interpolation issues at grid boundaries.

- non-equidistant grid: upwinding still not currently possible, due to glitch in deriv_alt.

- other topics (not discussed in detail at this meeting):
  - reorganising the code to separate 'engine' from 'toolbox' (involving moving more code into special modules?)
  - reducing size of compiled src directory.  (dynamical linking?)
  - f2003

- future PC user meetings: probably Boulder for 2018;  a doodle-poll will be arranged for dates.  (Future possibilities discussed include Aalto and Goethenburg (t.b.c.), possibly also Ventura, Zhejiang?)  Also considering the possibility of running alongside an associated meeting, for a wider science community. (Axel)
