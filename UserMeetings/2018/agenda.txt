- Report from the Pencil Code Steering Committee (OK)

- Scientific use of the Pencil Code (OK)
    ~/pencil-code/doc/citations/notes.pdf
    http://pencil-code.nordita.org/doc/citations.pdf

- GAFD Special Issue (update) (OK)

- Complaints? (e.g. long compile time etc)

- IDL auto-tests? Similar things for python?

- New code developments/status reports? E.g.:
    acscalar (active scalar)
    slope limited diffusion? (OK)
    gravitational waves (OK)
    Yin-Yang grid (OK)
    chemistry?
    src/cuda? (OK)
    grid refinement? (OK)
    turbulence test problem against inviscous codes.
    not all the idl code exists in python (and vice versa?)
    code clean-up (walking into someone's attic)

- 'decoupling sample from website': Create new 'highlights'/'production_runs' directory in repository, for 'serious' simulations (cf. the smaller problems considered in samples).  Also expand highlights on website with additional examples (chase up individuals currently with unexpanded listings). Adopt *.md format for README files on github. [Many?]

- python/pencilnew: these (more object-orientated) python scripts now functional for most purposes; users encouraged to use them. More functionalities will be ported soon. Sim objects largely functional.

- HDF5: currently implemented, beyond minor issue with persistent variables used by some modules (particularly any processor-dependent variables: e.g. random seed?). And some particles files not yet dealt with: needs work on particles modules (some 'direct' writes to unformatted fortran output should be replaced by calls to routines in the i/o modules.)

- auto-test (Jenkins server) (OK)

- documentation: some (many?) modules not currently documented in manual. (OK)

- is anybody having problems with getconf (too "convoluted")?

- should src/*.local files reside and be checked in elsewhere?
  And should one link the entire src directory -s the -s option?

- initialize wth NaN? (OK)

- github emails (git log --since 2015 --pretty=format:"%an %ae)
  see email of 13 Jul 2017 (OK)
