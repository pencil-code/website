# http://pencil-code.nordita.org/UserMeetings/2023/agenda.txt

- promote practice of making init routines additive.

- Newsletter: feedback

- Summary from the Pencil Code Steering Committee

- restart problems with param.nml being outdated (add details in manual)
  Find out & document what practice exactly leads to problems

- Status of HDF5: why is it slow, and how slow is it?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
OLD ITEMS:

- review of auto-test sensitivities

- updates of various data bases (pencil-code/license/developers.txt and https://www.nordita.org/~brandenb/pencil-code/PCSC/committers/list.pdf, for example)

- to explain in manual how special works

- do multiple simulations via a special special (Lyapunov exp, diff latitude)

- should we rename some more README files to README.md

- to add src/pc_build_details (Status; Philippe?)

- user-specific initialization (Status: Philippe) ***

- make pc_read_xyaver independent of proc*/dim.dat

- default settings for compilation: read_all_videofiles (and what does pc_videofiles do?)

- paraview or yt 3-D visualization tutorials?

NEW ITEMS:

- register_report_aux versus 

- file size in samples

- add HDF5 distributed IO to handle huge data files (similar to IO_collective?) (Fred)

- make HDF5 IO reading of persistent variables robust against changes in number of processors (Fred) 

How to deal with inactive owners?

How to deal with broken auto-test: Joern

EoS and energy module combinability: general re-design

Nonuniform output of snapshots

How to enforce certain coding standards, for example how to deal with shared variables, registering, etc.

Higgsless implementation in non-relativistic code: Ramkishor

GPU accelerated 

HDF5: break up, slices (Fred Gent): future i/o strategies, but backwards compatible 

MAC users

Matthias: make energy module more general

run scripts (any advantage?)

documentation/tests of relativistic options in hydro and MHD

Preliminary schedule:

Thursday: generalize scale factor reading
