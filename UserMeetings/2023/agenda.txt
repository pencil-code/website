# http://pencil-code.nordita.org/UserMeetings/2023/agenda.txt

- promote practice of making init routines additive.

- Newsletter: feedback

- Summary from the Pencil Code Steering Committee

- restart problems with param.nml being outdated (add details in manual)
  Find out & document what practice exactly leads to problems

- Status of HDF5: why is it slow, and how slow is it?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
OLD ITEMS:

- review of auto-test sensitivities (accuracies too high)
  reference.out versus reference.out.double
  resolved for now.

- updates of various data bases (pencil-code/license/developers.txt and https://www.nordita.org/~brandenb/pencil-code/PCSC/committers/list.pdf, for example)
  AM1

- to explain in manual how multiple special works
  for Matthias to do after the meeting.

- do multiple simulations via a special special (Lyapunov exp, diff latitude)
  Scanning parameter space in one go (script exists, but python not documented)

- should we rename some more README files in sample to README.md
  Can use link. Philippe to code some script.

- to add src/pc_build_details (Status; Philippe?)
  Too that is planned. Scans *.in file, to suggest papers to cite.

- user-specific initialization (Status: Philippe) ***
  Philippe+Matthias to discuss: need environment variable etc.

- make pc_read_xyaver independent of proc*/dim.dat
  to postpone.

- user-specific settings for compilation: read_all_videofiles (and what does pc_videofiles do?)
  postpone to next office hours.

- paraview or yt 3-D visualization tutorials?
  postpone.

NEW ITEMS:

- register_report_aux versus 

- file size in samples

- add HDF5 distributed IO to handle huge data files (similar to IO_collective?) (Fred)

- make HDF5 IO reading of persistent variables robust against changes in number of processors (Fred) 

How to deal with inactive owners?

How to deal with broken auto-test: Joern

EoS and energy module combinability: general re-design

Nonuniform output of snapshots

How to enforce certain coding standards, for example how to deal with shared variables, registering, etc.

Higgsless implementation in non-relativistic code: Ramkishor

GPU accelerated 

HDF5: break up, slices (Fred Gent): future i/o strategies, but backwards compatible 

MAC users

Matthias: make energy module more general

run scripts (any advantage?)

documentation/tests of relativistic options in hydro and MHD

Preliminary schedule:

Thursday: generalize scale factor reading

use of pointmasses and/coding 

early_finalize: to discuss & present when to use, or to control from outside for testing purposes.
